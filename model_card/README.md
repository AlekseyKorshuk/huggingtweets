I was created by [huggingtweets](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets).

Make your own bot based on your favorite user with [the demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/borisdayma/huggingtweets/blob/master/huggingtweets-demo.ipynb).

## Intended uses & limitations

#### How to use

You can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation:

```python
>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed
>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='huggingtweets/USER_HANDLE')
>>> generator("My dream is", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=5)
```

#### Limitations and bias

The model suffers from [the same limitations and bias as GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2#limitations-and-bias).

In addition, the data present in the user's tweets further affects the text generated by the model.

## How does it work?

The model uses the following pipeline.

![pipeline](https://github.com/borisdayma/huggingtweets/blob/master/img/pipeline.png?raw=true)

To understand how the model was developed, check the [W&B report](https://bit.ly/2TGXMZf).

## Training data

The model was trained on [@USER_HANDLE's tweets](https://twitter.com/USER_HANDLE).

| Data              | Quantity     |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Tweets downloaded | TWEETS_DL    |
| Retweets          | RETWEETS     |
| Short tweets      | SHORT_TWEETS |
| Tweets kept       | TWEETS_KEPT  |

[Explore the data](WANDB_PREPROCESS/artifacts), which is tracked with [W&B artifacts](https://docs.wandb.com/artifacts) at every step of the pipeline.

## Training procedure

The model is based on a pre-trained [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) which is fine-tuned on @USER_HANDLE's tweets for 4 epochs.

Hyperparameters and metrics are recorded in the [W&B training run](WANDB_TRAIN).
