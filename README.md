# HuggingTweets

*Tweet Generation with Huggingface*

Disclaimer: this demo is not to be used to publish any false generated information but to perform research on Natural Language Generation (NLG).

## Introduction

This project fine-tune a pre-trained transformer on a user's tweets using [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).

Training and results are logged on [W&B](https://docs.wandb.com/huggingface) (which is integrated in HuggingFace).

## Usage

1. Install dependencies through `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or manually.
2. Follow the notebook `huggingtweets.ipynb` (I like to use Jupyter Lab).

## Results

A few interesting points:

* pretty impressive results on such tiny datasets (100 kB) ;
* predictions are definitely better the more data we have (too bad we're limited to only 3200 tweets) ; if you don't have enough data just try a few different seeds to see if you get something interesting ;
* I thought it would mainly memorize tweets but there's definitely creativity ; I want to test training top layers vs bottom layers to see how it affects learning of lexical field (subject of content) vs memorizing words ;
* I first ran it on @l2k (Lukas Biewald) but results were really strange so I thought it didn't work (he must have wild conversation subjects), then ran it on Trump and clearly saw the model was "learning" something! Always better to start training on tweeters with a very unique writing style!

And finally, my favorite sample is definitely on Andrej Karpathy, start of sentence "I don't like":

> I don't like this :) 9:20am: Forget this little low code and preprocessor optimization. Even if it's neat, for top-level projects. 9:27am: Other useful code examples? It's not kind of best code, :) 9:37am: Python drawing bug like crazy, restarts regular web browsing ;) 9:46am: Okay, I don't mind. Maybe I should try that out! I'll investigate it :) 10:00am: I think I should try Shigemitsu's imgur page. Or the minimalist website if you're after 10/10 results :) Also maybe Google ImageNet on "Yelp" instead :) 10:05am: Looking forward to watching it talk!

I had a lot of fun running predictions on other people too!
